                <p className="welcome-text">
                Thanks so much for stopping by Flam Dragon! Created by drummers and for drummers, Flam Dragon is a different kind of shop. We don't operate by a traditional model, which is to say that we don't make inventory and we don't sell inventory. Instead, we partner with like-minded small businesses and shops that love drummers and percussionists as much as we do.

                "That's great," we can hear you saying. "But what does it mean?" We're so glad you asked!
                </p>
                <p>
                We feature some of our favorite items (with a bent toward drumsticks), and if you make a purchase through our affiliate link, we get a cut. Great deals for you, great exposure to the businesses we partner with, and we make a few bucks too. Win, win, win--that's one sweet-sounding triplet!
                </p>

                This month, we're proud to be partnering with <a className="memphis-drum-shop" href="https://memphisdrumshop.com/">Memphis Drum Shop</a>. Check out some of the products we're featuring from them. If you don't see what you need, they're sure to either have it available in the store or online. And if they don't, they can probably get it for you.
                </p>
                <p>
