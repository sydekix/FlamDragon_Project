# FlamDragon_Project
A full-stack , faux-store, final-project website

Front End  
The site is a React single-page application, written in JSX and JavaScript. It’s styled with a combination of vanilla CSS and Bootstrap, with the exception of the carousel. (It uses the React-Bootstrap library, which I found played better with React than the standard carousel from Bootstrap.)  Back End:  The site employs Node and Express on the back end, with MySQL for the database queries. (This is not a production app, so the database is hosted on my local machine.) The database: 1) pulls data from a “products” table to populate the Products page, and 2) accepts user input on the Newsletter page to store names and email addresses in a “customers” table .

Additional Libraries Used:

I used the hamburger-react package for my animated hamburger menu. I used the react-router-dom package for the routing.
