# FlamDragon_Project
A full-stack, faux-store, final-project website for Mississippi Coding Academies

## Project Requirements

### Build an online store using Node.js on the back end and React on the front end.

- Must have a home, about, all products, and single product page
- Build a database that has the inventory and any other tables that are needed
- Using Node.js and Express, build an api to connect to the database
- Using React, render the data to the browser and the appropriate pages
- Must have a form (either contact or inventory) to collect data from the end client and store into the database
- Must be responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)

## Front End  

The site is a React single-page application. The file structure was created with Create React App. The front end is written with HTML/JavaScript/JSX. It’s styled with a combination of vanilla CSS and Bootstrap, with the exception of the carousel, which uses the React-Bootstrap library. 

## Back End

The site employs Node and Express on the back end, with MySQL for the database queries. (This is not a production app, so the database is hosted on my local machine.) The database: 1) pulls data from a “products” table to populate the Products page, and 2) accepts user input on the Newsletter page to store names and email addresses in a “customers” table .

## Additional Libraries Used

I used the hamburger-react package for my animated hamburger menu.  For the routing, I used the react-router-dom package.
