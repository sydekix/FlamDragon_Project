# FlamDragon_Project
A full-stack, faux-store, final-project website

## `hsl(63, 94%, 49%)`Project Requirements

Build an online store using Node.js on the back end and React on the front end.

Must have a home, about, all products, and single product page
Build a database that has the inventory and any other tables that are needed
Using Node.js and Express, build an api to connect to the database
Using React, render the data to the browser and the appropriate pages
Must have a form (either contact or inventory) to collect data from the end client and store into the database
Must be responsive (mobile, tablet, desktop)


## Front End  

The site is a React single-page application, written in JSX and JavaScript. It’s styled with a combination of vanilla CSS and Bootstrap, with the exception of the carousel. (It uses the React-Bootstrap library, which I found played better with React than the standard carousel from Bootstrap.)

##   Back End

The site employs Node and Express on the back end, with MySQL for the database queries. (This is not a production app, so the database is hosted on my local machine.) The database: 1) pulls data from a “products” table to populate the Products page, and 2) accepts user input on the Newsletter page to store names and email addresses in a “customers” table .

## Additional Libraries Used

I used the hamburger-react package for my animated hamburger menu. I used the react-router-dom package for the routing.
